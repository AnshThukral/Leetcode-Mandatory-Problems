Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, print the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [nums[l],nums[l+1],...,nums[r−1],nums[r]] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0

instead.

Input Format

    The first line of input contains N

, number of elements in the array nums
.
The second line of input contains N
space - separated positive integers.
The third line of input contains T
, number of testcases.
First line of each testcase contains target

    .

Constraints

    1

≤ T ≤ 100
1
≤ N ≤ 105
1
≤ nums[i] ≤ 105
1
≤ target ≤ 109

Output Format

    Print the minimum length of contiguous subarray for every testcase, if found. Otherwise, print 0

    .

Sample Input 0

0

Explanation

    The subarray [4,3]

has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
The subarray [4]
has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
No subarray with sum greater than equal to 16

    .
